# MLH-SacHacks-2021

## Inspiration
The pandemic has made life a lot harder (i.e. people losing jobs, people can’t socialize in public, and people are dying). Nonprofits are giving free stuff away and hosting online events but people aren’t aware of them. Social media can promote free stuff/giveaway events from nonprofits but it’s hard for these posts to effectively reach the right audience because they are buried under social posts—a platform that selectively shows charitable events, giveaways, and other covid-related assistance/help is needed. 

## What it does
Auxilium is a stand-alone website that shows only free resources and services from nonprofits. As a participant, you can pick up free resources from physical locations within  your county or attend online events hosted by any nonprofit anywhere in the world. 

## How we built it
We built this project through low-and high-fidelity prototyping on Figma, vector illustrations on Adobe Illustrator, presentation visuals on Adobe InDesign, and frontend on React and backend on NodeJS.

## Challenges we ran into
Originally, we were a team of four with two designers and two developers. We lost one developer as he didn’t communicate with us about his conflicting schedule and eventually he didn’t show up when we started the hack. 

This hackathon was held remotely due to the  limitations posed by COVID-19, it took longer for team members to communicate with each other as we have to gauge whether they were available based on their Discord status and teammates live in a shared space with family. Because of this, conveying and aligning ideas with one another took a little longer than it would’ve been in-person.

In terms of our project, we worked with the skills and time we had available. We couldn’t participate in all tracks as our skillset couldn’t meet all the minimum requirements (i.e. Best IBM Z, Best Data Science).  This website is intended to exist on the Internet for people to use however we’re launching it without running usability testing to ensure the website is functional. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Each part of this project was executed with careful consideration to our potential users. We’re proud that we somehow made this project happen, even in the midst of COVID-19! Everyone shared the same passion for providing the community with support during such a troubling time. 

## What we learned
Some of the valuable knowledge we gained from this project include:
Thinking in the perspective of potential different users
Ensuring a welcoming design through cross-testing of different colors to ensure that visually impaired people can access the website and its content
Giving each other objective, constructive feedback
Effective communication between designers & the programmer for efficiency and executing designs
Having fun and enjoying whatever the hackathon throws at you :) 

## What's next for auxilium
We hope to have nonprofits and community members use this platform so we would run some usability testing and iterate based on our findings. 
Updated Styles for responsive design  on all platforms ( designed for 1920x940 browser, ‘firefox’ )
more complex and useful firebase interactions
more intuitive/ fulfilling user flow
